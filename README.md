# CyberCoverOps

A Unity-based project combining interactive gameplay and educational cryptography concepts. This project demonstrates the implementation of Caesar and Playfair cipher encryption techniques in Unity, along with basic 3D gameplay mechanics.

## Features

### Cryptography Mini-Games:
1. **Caesar Cipher Game**  
   - Encrypts a randomly selected word using a Caesar cipher.  
   - Players decrypt the text using the given key.  
   - Feedback is provided on whether the decryption is correct.  

2. **Playfair Cipher Game**  
   - Encrypts a plaintext using the Playfair cipher algorithm.  
   - Players attempt to match the encrypted text.  
   - Correct and incorrect feedback is displayed dynamically.

### Gameplay Mechanics:
- **Capsule Controller**: A 3D capsule moves in a scene using WASD or arrow keys.  
- **Collision-Based Scene Transition**:  
  - Collision with a "Deceptive Door" leads to a different scene.  
  - Collision with a "Correct Door" keeps the player in the same scene.
